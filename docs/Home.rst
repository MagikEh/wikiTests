About the wiki
--------------

Using `retSructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ for this wiki as it supports the `direct creation of man pages <https://manpages.debian.org/testing/docutils-common/rst2man.1.en.html>`_.

Navigation
----------

localization is offered by adding the code to the end of the filename. (before the file extension)
Users may switch to french using the sidebar or otherwise adding '``_fr``' to the end of the url.
To switch to english (the default) simply remove localization from the url or use the sidebar.


ToDo
----
- Maybe include an elevator pitch as well as some more wordy navigation cues that align with the sidebar.
- French is translated easily using `Deepl <https://www.deepl.com/translator>`_
   * Could also script up a way to translate, create dirs, alter the relevant sidebar as to include localized links...
- Emojiis pulled from `Unicode.org <https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html>`_
